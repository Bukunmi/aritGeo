A function called **aritGeo** that takes one argument, an array. It checks if the array passed as an argument is arithmetic, geometric, neither arithmetic nor geometric in progression or if the array is empty. For arithmetic progressions, it return `Arithmetic`. For geometric progressions, it returns `Geometric`. For neither of the above, It returns **`-1`**. For an empty array, It returns **`0`**. The tests for the solution was done using **Mocha** & **Chai** (with at least 10 test cases).
